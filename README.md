Javascript Flip Clock Counter

This is a strange completely custom idea done for a client. I am working on creating a more customizable version.

This counter starts from 0 at a specified start date and counts up to a final value (set to 3000000) ending at a specified end date.

The counter does a 1 second flip animation every few seconds to reveal a value that has passed since the last flip.

The counter will stop at 3000000 on the specified end date.
